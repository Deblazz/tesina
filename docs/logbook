    Half an hour of work

    Now users can compare slightly different images, using a circa matching color pattern
    An hour of work

_07/05/2021
    Created this logbook
    Automatic creation of output image
    Divided image analysis into 4 threads
    Implementation is not excellent, not dynamic(according to number of available threads on the machine), a bit slow and clunky, throws OutofMemoryError exception if image is large (16K res not working, 4k works)
    An hour of work
